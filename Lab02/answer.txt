Question:

If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title, then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does Java allow you to do this?
Answer:

In Java, constructors must have unique signatures to differentiate between them. A constructorâ€™s signature includes its name (which is the class name) and the types (and order) of its parameters. If both constructors take the same number and types of parameters, Java will not allow this because the signatures will be identical, leading to a compile-time error. For example, if both constructors accept a String as a parameter (one for title and one for category), Java will not be able to distinguish between the two.
